# Configuring CLA for a Foundation

A Foundation, also called Group of Projects, is a project that has sub projects under it. As a project manager or an administrator, you can configure CLA for a foundation or a sub project under the foundation. For foundations such as CNCF, you configure CLA for the foundation, and it is applicable to all the sub projects that come under the foundation.

To Configure CLA for a Foundation:

 1. On the Foundation page, click **Add new CLA Group**.  
     New CLA Group window appears.

3. Select type of check boxes that you want to implement for the contributors of the project.  
**Note:** A warning message appears if you select only one check box. Click the help icons next to fields or check boxes to know more.
