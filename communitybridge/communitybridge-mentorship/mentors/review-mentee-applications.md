# Review Mentee Applications

You can review mentees applications from the Current Mentees tab on the project detail page.  This tab lists all the mentee applicants. After an individual creates a mentee profile and applies to a project, the person becomes a mentee applicant for the project. An email notification informs you that the person showed interest in participating in the project's Mentorship program. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Mentee's name shows under **Current** **Mentees** tab with the application status.
{% endhint %}
