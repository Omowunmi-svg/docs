# Manage Mentee Application

You can manage your project mentees from the Current Mentees tab on the project detail page.  This tab lists all the mentee applicants. After an individual creates a mentee profile and applies to a project, the person becomes a mentee applicant for the project. An email notification informs you that the person showed interest in participating in the project's Mentorship program. 

{% hint style="info" %}
* After a mentee applies to a project, the mentee's name shows under **Current** **Mentees** tab with application status **Pending**, by default..
* After you accept a mentee application from Application Status drop-down, accepted mentee's profile appears under the Mentees section on the Dashboard tab of your project.
{% endhint %}

1. [Sign in](../../../sso/sign-in/) to [CommunityBridge Mentorship.](https://people.communitybridge.org/)
