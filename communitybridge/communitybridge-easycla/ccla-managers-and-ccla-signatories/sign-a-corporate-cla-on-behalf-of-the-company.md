# Sign a Corporate CLA on Behalf of a Company

As a CCLA signatory, you must be authorized by your company to sign a Corporate CLA on its behalf. If you are a CCLA manager but not a CCLA signatory, you can request that the CCLA signatory sign the Corporate CLA.

**Do these steps:**

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md).

The CLA Corporate Console appears and shows Companies.

2. Click the company for which you want to sign a Corporate CLA.  
The page displays projects with signed CLAs, pending requests to sign CLA, and sign new CLA sections. 

3. Click **SIGN** **NEW CLA**.

â€‹[The CCLA signatory receives a CLA Sign Request](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md) email, reviews and signs the document.

After the Corporate CLA is signed, the Company page shows the signed Corporate CLA under Signed Project CCLAs. You receive a CLA Signed Document email with an attached document PDF. Contributors to the company project simply need to confirm their association to the company, and then they can continue with their pull requests. Their subsequent contributions will not require association confirmations.

_A Corporate CLA that is signed by the CCLA signatory remains in effect even when that CCLA signatory is no longer employed at a company._
